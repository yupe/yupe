YiiBooster 2.0.0
================

YiiBooster is a widget toolkit for [Yii web framework](http://www.yiiframework.com).
Its main purpose is to ease building UI in Yii-based web applications utilizing the beauty of [Twitter Bootstrap][twitter-bootstrap]
and several other great UI plugins developed over time by the community.

Twitter Bootstrap wrapping is based over the excellent job of [Christoffer Niska](https://twitter.com/Crisu83) called [Yii-Bootstrap](http://www.cniska.net/yii-bootstrap/).
We at [Clevertech](http://clevertech.biz) included his library into our own Yii project startup library, [YiiBoilerplate](http://github.com/clevertech/yiiboilerplate),
and started improving it in order to satisfy some of our customers' project requirements.
YiiBooster is an end result of this effort.

## Widgets at a glance
Overall, the following is included in YiiBooster:

*   All of most current [Twitter Bootstrap][twitter-bootstrap] goodness we were able to integrate with.
*   [FontAwesome icons pack](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) for Twitter Bootstrap.
*   [jQuery File Upload](https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload) widget for fancy file uploads.
*   [jQueryUI/Bootstrap](http://addyosmani.github.io/jquery-ui-bootstrap/) integration.
*   [Select2](http://ivaynberg.github.io/select2/) widget for fancy selectors.
*   [X-Editable](http://vitalets.github.io/x-editable/) plugin for in-place editing of table cells values.
*   Absolutely crazy custom grid views called [TbExtendedGridView](http://yii-booster.clevertech.biz/extended-grid.html) and [TbJsonGridView](http://yii-booster.clevertech.biz/json-grid.html), packed with features to the brim.
*   *Four* different WYSIWYG editors for you to choose:

    * [wysihtml5](https://github.com/xing/wysihtml5) [with Bootstrap integration](https://github.com/jhollingworth/bootstrap-wysihtml5),
    * [jQuery Markdown](https://github.com/arhpreston/jquery-markdown),
    * [CKEditor](http://ckeditor.com/) and
    * [Redactor](http://imperavi.com/redactor/).

    And don't be afraid to use Redactor, because Yii community bought an ORM license for it.
*   And several other little and not-so-little widgets for you to use.

## Quick Start

If you want, you can clone the [github repo](https://github.com/clevertech/YiiBooster) and get the full codebase
to build the distributive or documentation or just to hack something.

If you just want to _use_ YiiBooster, you need to [download the latest distributive archive](https://sourceforge.net/projects/yiibooster/files/latest/download?source=files).
After that, consult the [YiiBooster documentation website][booster-docs] or the `INSTALL.md` file included in the package.
